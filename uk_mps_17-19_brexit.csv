Previously the argument was that we had to keep no Deal on the table for negotiating purposes.

That amendment, from former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin, withheld approval of the PM's Brexit deal until legislation to implement it is in place. The motion proved a major stumbling block for the government as the meaningful vote on the deal was pulled and by law the PM will now have to ask the EU for an extension beyond October 31.

After all most of these matters- the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice-versa, the carriage of drugs over borders, and a host of detailed and technical matters were all agreed in the 750-page Withdrawal Agreement.
